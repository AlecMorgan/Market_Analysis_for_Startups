# Market Analysis for Startups
A work-in-progress analysis of the optimal industry, time of year, etc to launch an entrepreneurial venture in.

By tapping into these sources I aim to provide insights that may help prospective entrepreneurs decide when and how to launch their new business in order to have the best odds of success.
